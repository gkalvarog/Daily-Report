# This is no longer only a Report app

# Introduction
Before this system, generating reports was a manual, time-consuming process. Errors were common, and extracting key insights required extensive effort. This new system automates the process, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and significantly reducing the time required to analyze data.

# System Overview

## Without this system, we have:
- **Manual reporting on Telegram**
- **Manual addition** of the worst and best chats to the dedicated spreadsheet
- **Manual collection** of the reports by the QA superiors
- **Decentralized data entry** with several spreadsheets to fill in / multiple TG groups to add information
- **No ease of analysis:** To analyze a certain range of time, it requires manual data collection and filtering

This leads to:
- Typos
- Constant requests for correction, which are time-consuming and hinder smooth workflow
- Incorrect counts, necessitating extra verification of the entered data
- Distributed focus across diverse spreadsheets, causing distraction and slowing workflow

## With this system, we have:
- **Data accuracy and consistency:** Names are pre-selected with no space for typos, ensuring uniformity in formatting (e.g., lower-case, different names).
- **Centralized data entry structure:** Significantly enhances workflow and reduces the need for additional tools.
- **Flexibility of analysis:** Data filters allow focused information retrieval.

# Key Functionalities
- Pulling data from multiple Google Sheets
- Aggregating key metrics such as:
  - Total entries per employee
  - Crit counts per agent
  - Entries marked as 'In Progress' to assess how many entries were incomplete for a certain time period
- **Exporting the report** in CSV format, compatible with Google Sheets, Excel, and SQL databases

# Benefits to the Department
- **Efficiency:** Automates report generation, managed by the team lead or responsible analytics personnel, saving valuable time.
- **Accuracy:** Reduces human errors in data extraction.
- **Decision-Making:** Provides structured analytics for better insights.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded with additional features in the future.

# Future Potential
While the system is already highly functional, potential improvements include:
- Enhancing the UI for improved user experience
- Adding more advanced filtering options
- Integrating with additional data sources for broader analytics
